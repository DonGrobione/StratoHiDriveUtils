# Copilot Project Rules

## 1. Documentation
- Keep README.md current: project structure, purpose of every user-facing file and directory, prerequisites, configuration, and usage.
- Write code, comments, comment-based help, output, log messages, and documentation in English.
- Do not insert line breaks in the middle of a sentence in README.md, comment-based help, or regular comments. Start new lines only between complete sentences or list items.
- Give every commit a clear message describing what changed and why.
- After code changes, verify that examples, file structure, and guidelines match the codebase.

## 2. Comment-Based Help And Comments
- Each .ps1/.psm1 file must contain exactly one comment-based help block as the first content in the file. Only an optional #requires statement may precede it.
- Comment-based help blocks inside functions or elsewhere in the file are strictly forbidden.
- All other comments must be regular single-line # comments.
- Every function must have a concise regular comment immediately before its definition, describing its responsibility and observable behavior.

## 3. PowerShell Standards (Windows PowerShell 5.1)
- All .ps1 and .psm1 files must parse and run in Windows PowerShell 5.1. Do not use PowerShell 6+ syntax, operators, automatic variables, or cmdlets.
- Use approved verbs for function names (verify with Get-Verb) and descriptive PascalCase/camelCase names without abbreviations (except loop counters).
- Keep functions single-responsibility, action-oriented, with early returns to reduce nesting.
- Validate inputs and paths at boundaries. Use Join-Path for constructed paths, Test-Path with -PathType before dependent operations, and -ErrorAction Stop for operations handled by try/catch.
- Avoid aliases, Invoke-Expression, wildcard exports, global state, and unnecessary side effects.
- Enable Set-StrictMode -Version Latest only after verifying that the complete script and all imported modules support it in PowerShell 5.1.

## 4. Logging And Error Handling
- Write-Log.psm1 is the only module allowed to write log files or emit project log entries.
- Modules and library scripts must not contain logging code, call Write-Log, or write log files. They return data, status objects, exception records, or error objects to the calling script.
- The orchestrator or standalone entry point script decides which events are logged and at what verbosity level, and calls Write-Log for those events.
- Every logfile entry must identify the emitting script name as prefix (for example [MyScript.ps1]).
- Child scripts must catch their own errors, rethrow with throw so failures bubble to the orchestrator, and let the orchestrator decide the final logging.
- The orchestrator prints errors to terminal and writes log entries via Write-Log. It must not write duplicate log entries for errors already logged.
- Scripts return exit code 0 on success and 1 on unhandled failure. Standalone entry points and orchestrators use exit codes; sub-scripts called by an orchestrator rely on the orchestrator's exit handling.
- Project-internal paths are logged as relative paths from the repository root; paths under $env:TEMP are logged as absolute paths.
- Temporary files must be created under $env:TEMP and removed after use.

## 5. Security
- Never trust user input. Apply defense in depth, least privilege, and fail-securely principles.
- Never store secrets in code. Read credentials, tokens, and API keys at runtime from a .psd1 file under Secrets/.
- Do not log secret values.

## 6. Validation
- Parse changed PowerShell files with Windows PowerShell 5.1 before completing work.
- Run PSScriptAnalyzer where available and fix diagnostics introduced by the change.

## 7. Versioning
- For modules (.psm1 with manifest .psd1): the .psd1 manifest is the single source of truth for versioning. Do not duplicate version metadata inside comment-based help blocks.
- For standalone scripts (.ps1 without manifest): include a version number in the comment-based help block and keep it current when behavior changes.

## 8. Copilot Rules And Memory
- Project rules live only in .github/copilot-instructions.md.
- Repository memory lives only in .github/repo-memory.md. No other files are permitted inside .github/.
- Read .github/repo-memory.md before starting work on the repository.

## 9. Project-Specific Rules (StratoHiDriveUtils)
- This project is a module. It must not write log entries itself. The importing script is responsible for logging.
- Use [CmdletBinding()] for advanced functions, including SupportsShouldProcess for state-changing or destructive actions.
- Explicitly define VariablesToExport = @(), CmdletsToExport = @(), AliasesToExport = @(), and FunctionsToExport in the module manifest (.psd1).
- Set-StrictMode -Version Latest is mandatory at script/module scope.
- Store standalone installer scripts at the project root.
- Mention in README.md that AI/KI tooling was used to support the creation of this module.
